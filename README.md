# HandsON-ML-TF2
Learning ML with O'Reilly's Hands-On Machine Learning with Sklearn, Tensorflow, and Keras, by Aurélien Géron.

All codes are from https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/ and the book itself. Datasets are avaliable online.

As a green hand in data science, I just typed the codes from the original notebook again to reinforce my memory and made a few extra explorations.

The rearrangement is not done yet!
The aim of this rearrangement is to provide a copy & paste library. I've already carried most of the comments from the book so you can leave the book alone. To learn the algorithms, please refer to the machine learning text books in Books folder. Next I'll delete some of the exercises and examples, rearrange the order of the functions, and categorize the functions based on their utilities.

Updates resume closely
